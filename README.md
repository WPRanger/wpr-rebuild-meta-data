WPR Rebuild Meta Data
=====================

## Simple plugin to rebuild corrupted WordPress image meta-data.

### Installation

Upload to wp-content/plugins and activate.

### How does it work?

Visit the WordPress Dashboard Tools Menu:

Click on *Rebuild Meta*

The plugin runs. You must then rebuild your thumbnails with a suitable tool.

I like Force Regenerate Thumbnails:
